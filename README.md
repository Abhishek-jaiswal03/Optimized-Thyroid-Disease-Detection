# Optimized Thyroid Disease Detection:A Multi Class Approach Using ML
This project is a web application built using Flask that predicts thyroid disease based on user input. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze various health parameters and provide a diagnosis. The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to input their health data and receive predictions regarding their thyroid health.

# Key Components
➼Flask Framework: The application is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework that allows for quick and easy development of web applications in Python. Flask handles routing, rendering HTML templates, and processing user input.

➼Machine Learning Model: The core functionality of the application is driven by a machine learning model that has been trained to recognize patterns in thyroid-related health parameters. The model is loaded using Python's pickle library, allowing it to make predictions based on input data.

➼User Interface: The application features multiple routes that guide users through the prediction process:

  (I) Home Page: Provides an introduction and navigation to different sections of the application.

  (II) More Information Page: Offers detailed information about thyroid diseases, helping users understand the conditions they are learning about.

 (III) Prediction Input Page: A form where users can input their health parameters relevant to thyroid function.

 (IV)Prediction Results Page: Displays the prediction results based on the user's input, categorizing potential thyroid conditions such as compensated hypothyroid, no thyroid, primary hypothyroid, or secondary hypothyroid.

# Usage Flow
➼Access the Application: Users can start at the homepage and navigate to the prediction section.

➼Input Health Data: In the prediction form, users fill in their health-related information, including age, gender, and various thyroid hormone levels.

➼Receive Predictions: After submitting the form, the application processes the data and provides a prediction regarding the user's thyroid health.
